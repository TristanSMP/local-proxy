# local-proxy

Local proxy uses [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/arbitrary-tcp/#connect-from-a-client-machine) to locally proxy into Tristan SMP instead of using the [public reverse proxy](https://github.com/TristanSMP/edge-proxy).

## What it looks like

### Public reverse proxy

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(you)-->B(public reverse proxy)
    B-->C(cloudflare)
    C-->D(tristan smp)
```

### Local proxy

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(you)-->B(cloudflared)
    B-->C(tristan smp)
```

While this mod won't magically make your internet faster, it will make your connection to the server _faster_ due to the fact that you're not going through a reverse proxy making you do more network hops.
